# EasySchedule
Built this planner for scheduling my classes because of the tedious gen ed credit system

GUI was built in JavaFX, feel free to make any modification as needed.
Originally, I was going to parse the data with JDBC API but I can't run a database 24/7 on my laptop atm. So I wrote the data into CSV file for parsing. If you would like to add more courses, simply open the CSV file and fill in the parameters

OPTION:
To save a txt file of your schedule, simply go to file > save. It should create a file named "schedule.txt" in your folder

MISC:
The HashTable implemented in my code is a modified version of the code provided from one of my lecture
